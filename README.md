The development is still in progress and many features don't work so don't expect it to work as intended.

Run `npm run dev` to start development. The program will start a dev copy and it will refresh on code change.

## Code scaffolding

This software is generated with [Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io/) so you can use it's power!

## Build

Run `npm run package:windows` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `app/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io). No tests are written yet fo feel free to create your own.

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/). There are no e2e tests yet.
